# Data Logging Scripts

These are scripts used to create observing data logs for a night.  They include python scripts that scrape raw image FITS
headers to create instrument-specific data logs in our standard ASCII text format, and to retrieve LBT telemetry data
for the guide cameras (GCS) and environmental (weather) sensors for a night.
